# la-POO-
Gathering my notes and synthesis concerning object oriented programming. Why make a repo for that ? Because with POO, a code can be much more efficient, profesionnal and structured. 

the first part will mainly consist in a traduction and synthesis of the informations provided here : 

https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/1665806-programmez-en-oriente-objet-en-php/1666289-manipulation-de-donnees-stockees

i also planed to edit the README with the new notions i will have learned once i will have finished the gathering and filtering of informations within the docx document.
